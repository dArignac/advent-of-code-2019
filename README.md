# Advent of Code 2019 in Go
I'm starting to learn the language [Go](https://golang.org/) by solving the tasks of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

[Adrienne Tacke](http://adrienne.io/)'s tweets about this brought me to doing this, check out her solutions using javascript at [her Github repo](https://github.com/adriennetacke/advent-of-code-2019).

## Tests
To execute the tests run `go ./...` from the root or any day folder to just run the tests for the day.
